    </> These are not all the files to the full build folder. Most of the couldn't be uploaded in time.
    </> The Actual C# (.cs) files are inside Assets/Script/ and only the files ending in .cs (not .cs.meta)
    </> I will be uploading the rest of the files to hopefully make a working build and runable SDWAuto Inventory v2.

    </> All the statements about .cs, .cs.meta and Assets/Scripts/ still holds true even affter this update.
    </> Thats all folks :)
